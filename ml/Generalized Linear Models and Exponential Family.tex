\section{Generalized linear models (GLMs)}
\label{sec:GLMs}
Linear and logistic regression are examples of \textbf{generalized linear models}, or \textbf{GLM}s (McCullagh and Nelder 1989). These are models in which the output density is in the exponential family (Section \ref{sec:exponential-family}), and in which the mean parameters are a linear combination of the inputs, passed through a possibly nonlinear function, such as the logistic function. We describe GLMs in more detail below. We focus on scalar outputs for notational simplicity. (This excludes multinomial logistic regression, but this is just to simplify the presentation.)
