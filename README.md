#Artificial Intelligence cheat sheet
===================================

This cheat sheet contains many mathematical formula, equations,inference and diagrams on Artificial Intelligence.
Most of them are based on `Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning`,`Elements of Statisitical Learning` and `Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective`.

## Book review
For Bayesian treatment, refer to PRML. For more data mining practical issues refer to ESL.

##Download PDF
[cheat-sheet.pdf](https://github.com/Alexoner/ai-cheat-sheet/raw/master/cheat-sheet.pdf) 

##LaTeX template
This open-source book adopts the [Springer latex template](http://www.springer.com/authors/book+authors?SGWID=0-154102-12-970131-0).

##How to compile
1. Install [Tex Live 2012](http://www.tug.org/texlive/).
2. Install [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/).
3. Configure TeXstudio.  
    Run TeXstudio, click `Options-->Configure Texstudio-->Commands`, set `XeLaTex` to `xelatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex`.
    
    Click `Options-->Configure Texstudio-->Build`,   
    set `Build & View` to `Compile & View`,  
    set `Default Compiler` to `XeLaTex`,  
    set `PDF Viewer` to `Internal PDF Viewer(windowed)`, so that when previewing it will pop up a standalone window, which will be convenient.
4. Compile. Use Open `cheat-sheet.tex` with TeXstudioï¼Œclick the green arrow on the menu bar, then it will start to compile.  
    In the messages window below we can see the compilation command that TeXstudio is using is `xelatex -synctex=1 --enable-write18 -interaction=nonstopmode "cheat-sheet".tex`
